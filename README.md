# COVID-19-2020-to-2022-Data-Exploratory-Analysis-With-Linear-Regression-and-Polynomial-Features

Initially, I imported COVID-19 from the start of 2020 to the end of 2022. I broke the COVID-19 data into 3 sections: 2020, 2021, and 2022. I broke the data into these three sections because COVID-19 intially was extremely lethal and spreaded slower when compared to COVID-19 in 2022. As the initial strains of COVID-19 evolved, it became less lethal and spreaded extremely quicker. In this data exploratory analysis, I applied cross_val_score method on linear regression and polynomial features. In year 2020, 2021, and 2022, I explored the time versus the total amount of cases and the time versus the total amount of deaths. In this endeavor, I discovered COVID-19 cases in 2020 were spreading in a second degree polynomial. Fortunately, the COVID-19 deaths in 2020 were linear. In 2021, COVID-19 cases was not spreading exponentially. COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021 were linear. The reasons behind this are vaccincations and face masks. Finally, in 2022, both COVID-19 cases and deaths were at the rate of natural log. This does not seem surprising and it supports the idea that COVID-19 was spreading the quickest in 2022 but was not as lethal in 2020.
